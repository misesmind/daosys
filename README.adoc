== Summary

DAOSYS is a Solidity development and run-time framework extending Foundry aiming to provide enterprise level support.
Robust solutions to common problems and tools to simplify testing large code bases.
The aim is to minimize the potential for developer error, favor reproducibility, and facilitate standards compliance.

DAOSYS adopts a declarative Context based architecture.
Contexts are modular hookable factories.
The hooks allow for defining logic at deployment.
Deployments are handled using a Fixture based design.
Behavior based modules simplify testing large architectures for standards compliance.
Extensions to Foundry are provided to simplify usage when dealing with complex scenarios.

== Architecture

DAOSYS provides a modular factory in the Context.
